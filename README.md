sus(tainability) filter - optimized for canadian sustainability initiatives

[view demo](http://go.yuxiqin.ca/susFilter-ytdemo)

This instagram filter was made using a combination of Figma and SparkAR. This took like tops 2 hours to make, most of which was spent recording.

I used Figma's component feature to create cohesive-looking cards, and SparkAR to slap everything together at 2am

Includes 20+ initiatives that I painstakingly researched and summarized.
